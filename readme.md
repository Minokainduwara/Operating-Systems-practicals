🧠 Operating Systems Lab Practicals

This repository contains Operating Systems (OS) laboratory practical programs implemented as part of the university OS lab curriculum. The aim is to understand core OS concepts through hands-on programming, mainly using C on Linux/UNIX environments.

📌 Objectives

Understand process creation and management

Learn inter-process communication (IPC)

Implement CPU scheduling algorithms

Work with synchronization techniques

Explore memory management concepts

Gain practical exposure to system calls

🛠️ Technologies & Tools

Language: C

Compiler: GCC

OS: Linux / UNIX

Editor: VS Code / Terminal



🧪 List of Experiments

Process creation using fork()

Orphan and Zombie processes

Inter-process communication using Pipes

Shared Memory implementation

▶️ How to Compile & Run

gcc program_name.c -o program_name
./program_name

Example:

gcc fork_example.c -o fork
./fork

📖 Learning Outcomes

Clear understanding of OS internals

Confidence in using Linux system calls

Improved problem-solving using C

Strong foundation for advanced OS concepts

⚠️ Notes

Programs are written for educational purposes.

Outputs may vary depending on the OS and system load.

Some programs require execution with proper permissions.
